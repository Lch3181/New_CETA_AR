# Overview of the project development

Platform: windows OS, IOS, Android

IDE: Unity: 2019.2.0f (C#) package: Vuforia (AR)

For the app development, a 3D model of the CETA building is needed. 

Until the real model is ready by the gaming art member at Inkwell Studio.

A temporary “fake” model may be used to develop the scripts until the 3D model is ready.

3D model - built by Inkwell Studio

Scripts - done by CETA CS 


## 3D model interaction:
User as a player that can walk inside 3D models of CETA (Windows OS using arrow keys; IOS/Android using joystick)

Or if they are physically inside the building in reality, they can also use AR triggers inside the building (IOS/Android with camera)


## Major landmarks in new CETA building:
1st floor: offices (navigation), front door (map, indoor navigation), cafe, fireplace, bigtable(something interesting like game), signs (websites), robotics room, maker space (schedule link for reservation)

2rd floor: offices (navigation), classrooms (schedule), hubs, drone lab, conference rooms

3nd floor: offices (navigation), computer labs(schedule), classrooms(schedule), study rooms (schedule link for reservation)

Basement : machine shop


Phased development plan: it is to be done floor by floor. 

Starting with the 1st floor, moving to the 2nd, 3rd, then the basement.
